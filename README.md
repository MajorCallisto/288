# 288
288 is a custom designed kinetic installation comprised of 24x12 (288) “pixels” created out of sandwiched layers of polarized film. The pixels change appearance from solid /black to transparent on a white background.

288 will premier at FITC Toronto 2016 and is a collaboration between Colorfield, FUSE Marketing Group and Sophi Kravitz.
